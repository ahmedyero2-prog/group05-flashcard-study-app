## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.6 or higher
* Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** to your local machine using Git.

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ahmedyero2-prog/group05-flashcard-study-app.git](https://github.com/ahmedyero2-prog/group05-flashcard-study-app.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate** to the project directory.

    ```bash
    cd group05-flashcard-study-app
    ```

3.  **Create a virtual environment** to manage project dependencies. This is a best practice to avoid conflicts with your system's Python.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4.  **Activate the virtual environment**.

    * On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

### Running the Application

1.  With the virtual environment activated, navigate into the source directory.
    ```bash
    cd src
    ```

2.  Run the main application script.

    ```bash
    python app_final.py
    ```

A new window should open, and the app will be ready to use.
