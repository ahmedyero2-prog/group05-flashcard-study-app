# Flashcard Study App

This is a simple, yet robust, desktop application for creating, managing, and studying flashcards. Built with Python and Tkinter, it is designed to help you study more effectively by providing a clean user interface and essential features for spaced repetition.

---

Features
* Deck Management: Create new decks or load existing ones from the main menu.

* Card Creation: Easily add new flashcards to any deck with a dedicated card creation page.

* Local Persistence: All decks and cards are automatically saved as local JSON files, so your data is always safe.

* Comprehensive Error Handling: The app includes robust error-handling blocks to prevent crashes from corrupted files or permission issues, providing clear, user-friendly pop-up messages instead.

* Dynamic Study Mode: Study cards in a randomized order. The app tracks your progress, showing you how many cards you've completed.

* Automated Score Tracking: Your score is automatically tracked based on your study habits. Flipping a card to see the answer counts as an incorrect guess, while passing to the next card without flipping counts as a correct one.

* Simple UI: A clean and intuitive user interface designed for a focused study experience..

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.6 or higher
* Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** to your local machine using Git.

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ahmedyero2-prog/group05-flashcard-study-app.git](https://github.com/ahmedyero2-prog/group05-flashcard-study-app.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate** to the project directory.

    ```bash
    cd group05-flashcard-study-app
    ```

3.  **Create a virtual environment** to manage project dependencies. This is a best practice to avoid conflicts with your system's Python.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4.  **Activate the virtual environment**.

    * On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

### Running the Application

1.  With the virtual environment activated, navigate into the source directory.
    ```bash
    cd src
    ```

2.  Run the main application script.

    ```bash
    python app_final.py
    ```

A new window should open, and the app will be ready to use.
