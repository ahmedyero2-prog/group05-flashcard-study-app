🎨 UI Requirements
- Card view with flip animation (simple fade/replace)
- List of available decks
- Summary of study progress

🚀 MVP Acceptance Criteria
- A user can:
- Create a deck
- Add cards to it
- Run a study session
- Save results locally

🌱 Stretch Goals
- Spaced repetition algorithm
- Import/export decks
- Animated card flip
